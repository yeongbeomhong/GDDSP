The Python Scripts declaring Oscillators and Noise Generators were not made by Yeongbeom Hong(myself).
I just revised some lines, replacing old torch.rfft function with torch.fft.rfft function.

The Original Idea to use Oscillators and Noise Generators to consctruct audio was from : J, Engel(2020) "DDSP:DIFFERENTIABLE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING "

The Pytorch-based Scripts Oscillators and Noise Generators were made by Sungho Lee and Jongho Choi.
